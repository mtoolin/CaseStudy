## Presented by Michael Toolin, Venkat Karsala and Jamie Villenueva

A series of questions were presented regarding GDP data. First we are interested in the 13th country in the GDP rankings.
<!--- insert R code to display the 13th country --->

The second question presented was to find the average GDP rankings for the **High Income:OECD** group and the **High Income:nonOECD** group.
<!--- insert R code to display the averages here --->

Below is plot of for **GDP of all countries** by Income Group:
<!--- insert R code to show the plot            --->
<!---            ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}    --->
<!---               plot(pressure)              --->

The table below displays the GDP ranings seperated into 5 different groups.
<!--- insert R code to show the table of the 5 groups 
                  {r cars}
                  summary(cars)               --->

<!--- insert R code; how many countries in Lower middle group
      among the 38 nations with highest GDP           --->


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
